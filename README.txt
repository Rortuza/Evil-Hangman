Although my Evil Hangman game does function is it supposed to,  I was not able to implement an entire AVL tree into the game. I was able to create an insert function that creates a node and uses the push back function to add a new word, as well as a function which uses pop back to help shift the words when the user guesses a correct word. Functions to  clear the buffer, vector, and string after a game were also implemented. This was not the traditional method to make the game with, but this was unfortunately all I could do to make this game work.
